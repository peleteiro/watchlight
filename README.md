# Atalaia

A watchman for a 32×8 pixel display. It polls a JSON endpoint, rotates through the
screens it returns, and lights an alert when it can no longer reach fresh data.

Atalaia is **content-agnostic**: it knows nothing about what it shows. Every screen
arrives fully formed from the server — text, color, and an 8×8 icon bitmap — so
adding, removing, or restyling a screen is a server change, never a reflash. The
firmware's only opinions are *how to draw* and *when to admit it's offline*.

Target hardware is the **Ulanzi TC001** (ESP32 + WS2812B matrix), but any ESP32
board with a compatible 32×8 matrix works by adjusting the pins in `main.cpp`.

## The contract

Atalaia expects `GET {API_URL}` (sent with an `x-device-token` header) to return:

```json
{
  "ts": 1784027753,
  "staleAfter": 1800,
  "rotateSeconds": 8,
  "screens": [
    { "id": "users", "text": "258k", "color": "#3b82f6", "icon": "<384 hex chars>" }
  ]
}
```

| field | meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ts` | epoch seconds when the numbers were read (for the server; the firmware tracks its own last-success clock) |
| `staleAfter` | seconds of no successful fetch before the offline glyph replaces the screens |
| `rotateSeconds` | seconds each screen is shown before advancing |
| `screens[].text` | short string, pre-formatted for the display (`"258k"`, not `"258482"`) |
| `screens[].color` | `#rrggbb` text color |
| `screens[].icon` | 8×8 bitmap: 64 pixels × `rrggbb`, row-major, left→right, top→bottom (= 384 hex chars). `000000` is an off pixel. |

The device renders the icon on the left 8×8 and the text right-aligned in the
remaining 24px. It never interprets the values — a screen is just pixels.

**Why the bitmap travels in the payload:** so a new screen or icon is a server
deploy, never a firmware flash. At ~1.6 KB per poll it's a rounding error.

## Buttons

The three top-edge buttons drive navigation locally, without touching the server:

| button | action |
| :--- | :--- |
| left | previous screen |
| middle | pause / resume auto-rotation |
| right | next screen |

Stepping left or right resets the rotation timer, so a manual move never fights an
auto-advance. Pausing freezes the current screen; new data still fetches in the
background and the frozen screen refreshes in place. The pins (`26` / `27` / `14`)
match the TC001 — verify on hardware if a press does nothing on first flash.

## The offline glyph

If the last successful fetch is older than `staleAfter` (or none has happened
yet), Atalaia replaces everything with an amber warning triangle. This is
deliberate: a panel showing yesterday's number with a fresh face is worse than a
panel that admits it's blind.

## Setup

1. Copy `src/secrets.example.h` → `src/secrets.h` and fill in your WiFi
   networks, `API_URL`, and `API_TOKEN`. `secrets.h` is gitignored.
2. Flash with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org):
   ```bash
   pio run -t upload    # build + flash over USB
   pio device monitor   # serial logs at 115200
   ```
3. To revert to stock, reflash the Ulanzi firmware (keep a backup `.bin`).

`API_ROOT_CA` is optional. Empty = skip TLS validation (`setInsecure`), which is
fine on trusted WiFi but lets a machine on the same network read the token. Pin
the endpoint's root CA when the display lives on untrusted WiFi.

## Verify on first flash

These can't be confirmed without the hardware — check them when you flash:

- **Matrix orientation.** If the image is mirrored or rotated, adjust the
  `NEO_MATRIX_*` flags in `main.cpp`. The current flags target the TC001.
- **Data pin.** `MATRIX_PIN = 32` is the TC001's; other boards differ.
- **Text fit.** Values up to 4 characters fit; longer ones clip on the right.
  Scrolling long values is a natural next step.
